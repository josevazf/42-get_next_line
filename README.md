# 42 Common Core / get_next_line
This project is about coding a function that reads and returns a line from one (/mandatory) or multiple (/bonus) file descriptors.
###
Repeated calls to the function allow to read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
The returned line includes the terminating character `\n` except if the end of the file was reached and does not end with it. 
###
External functions allowed: read(), malloc() and free().
