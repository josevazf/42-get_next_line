# 42 Common Core / get_next_line
This project is about coding a function that reads and returns a line from one or multiple file descriptors
###
Most of these funcions already exist on standard C libraries and so this project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them. 
External functions allowed: write(), malloc() and free().
